## 🎯 Project Goals

The Mission Management System aims to modernize and streamline communication between sponsors and their sponsored children. Key objectives include:

- Replacing traditional paper-based communication with a secure digital platform
- Enabling faster, more efficient communication between sponsors and children
- Maintaining system integrity through verified sponsor registration
- Supporting missionaries in their communication and coordination efforts

### Sponsor Registration Process

To ensure system security and data integrity, sponsors must complete a verification process:

1. Sponsors receive a welcome letter containing:
   - A unique Sponsor ID
   - Their sponsored Child's ID
2. These IDs must be provided during registration
3. This two-factor verification helps prevent unauthorized access
4. Only verified sponsors can access the communication platform
